Abstract Factory
-------------------
Phone numbers have a particular rule on which they get generated depending on areas and countries. 
If at some point the application should be changed in order to support adding numbers form a new country, 
the code of the application would have to be changed and it would become more and more complicated.

In order to prevent it, the Abstract Factory design pattern is used. 
Using this pattern a framework is defined, which produces objects that follow a general pattern and at 
runtime this factory is paired with any concrete factory to produce objects that follow the pattern of a certain country. 
In other words, the Abstract Factory is a super-factory which creates other factories (Factory of factories).
